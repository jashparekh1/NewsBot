# Project Description


This Python script implements an autonomous agent that utilizes OpenAI and NewsAPI services to provide users with information and summaries based on their research questions. By leveraging OpenAI's language model, NewsAPI's news article database, and HuggingFace's text summarization pipeline, the script can generate answers to research questions and provide concise summaries of relevant news articles. With the integration of generative AI, the agent leverages the power of language models to generate informative responses and summaries, helping users in their search process.

# Usage
Make sure you have valid API keys for both OpenAI and NewsAPI. Run the script and follow the prompts to enter your specific research question. If the agent is able to summarize an answer to your question, it will print the summary as the 'Final Answer', else it will print 'No relevant news articles found'.

# Examples
