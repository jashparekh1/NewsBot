# NewsBot


This project is a Python script that implements an autonomous agent and utilizes the OpenAI and NewsAPI services to provide users with information and summaries based on their research questions. By leveraging OpenAI's language model, NewsAPI's news article database, and HuggingFace's text summarization pipeline, the script can generate answers to research questions and provide summaries of relevant news articles. Users can interact with the script by entering their research question, and the system will use the available tools to retrieve information and generate concise summaries to aid in their research process.
